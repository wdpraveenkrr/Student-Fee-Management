_____________________________________________________
This course introduces learners to Python, one of the most popular and versatile programming languages used in software development, data science, web development, and automation. The course begins with the basics of programming concepts and Python syntax, then progresses to more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming, file handling, libraries, and frameworks.

Through hands-on coding exercises, real-world projects, and problem-solving activities, participants will build the skills needed to write efficient, reusable, and well-structured Python programs. By the end of the course, learners will have a strong foundation in Python and be prepared to apply it in areas like web development, data analysis, machine learning, and automation scripting.
